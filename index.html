                <p>In the US we often take sanitation for granted, we flush the toilet and move along with the day without giving the waste a second thought. But imagine having that waste show up in your yard, having to live with it on a daily basis, or even worse, having it back up into your home after a heavy rain. Imagine that to ensure the waste is removed you would have to pay a full year’s salary, and that if you could not pay for this system in time you would be fined by the government and potentially even arrested for failing to act. Imagine if due to the characteristics of the soil and your inability to spend thousands of dollars on a septic system, that would likely fail in a matter of years, you and your children would be exposed to dangerous water-borne parasites. This is, and has been, the everyday reality for the citizens of Lowndes county.

                <p>Located southwest of Montgomery, Alabama, Lowndes County experiences historical legacies of racism and political disregard that magnify already significant water and sanitation problems and subsequent water quality related health impacts. Historically a site of plantation slavery, Lowndes County is a politically marginalized community, whose voice on this and other matters has been disregarded. The socio-political situation is exacerbated by geology characterized by nearly impenetrable soils, and an economically disenfranchised community who has limited means to implement and install conventional methods of addressing sewage containment. As a result, citizens of Lowndes County are currently dealing with limits in access to adequate health resources to respond to the repercussions of sewage overflow. This story map will walk through the historical and current physical geography and social conditions that contextualize the ongoing injustice in Lowndes County.

            <section data-scene="history">
                <h2>Historic Context</h2>
                <p>The current waste water management issues in Lowndes County, are better understood when viewed in a historical context. Lowndes County is located in the center of Alabama’s Black Belt region, originally named for the rich, black topsoil that allowed the thriving production of plantation crops, particularly cotton. This agricultural industry profited through the exploitation of enslaved peoples. Many of these people’s descendants still live in the Black Belt, adding a second connotation to the term. Stark power and wealth disparities along racial lines have been a fixture in the region, with the county once being known as “Bloody Lowndes” in reference to the high frequency of white violence used to control and terrorize the black residents. For many years the scare tactics were effective, in 1964 the county was 80% Black but not a single Black citizen was registered to vote [1].</p><p>

                    <p><img class="img-story" src="img/LCFO4.jpg" width="100%"/>
                <p>The citizens of the county played a major role in the Civil Rights era with the creation of Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO) which worked to register Black voters and introduced the Black Panther symbol which would later be adopted throughout the nation [2]. When hundreds, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, passed through Lowndes county on their historic march from Selma to Montgomery, many citizens of the county came to cheer them on and offer food and water with full knowledge that these actions could make them targets for violence. The county also served as a rest and campsite for 300 protesters during the march [3]. This activist spirit can still be seen in the county today in Organizations like The Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise (ACRE). ACRE works to address the needs of citizens who continue to face disproportionate rates of poverty and wastewater management issues that expose them to diseases which have been eradicated across most of the United States for decades. </p>

                    <small>The symbol of the racist Alabama Democratic party was a white rooster. To help African American population distinguish the new non-racist democratic party in Lowndes County from the racist Alabama Democratic party, they used the black panther symbol</small></p>

            <section data-scene="geology">
                <h2>Geology</h2>
                <p>The same characteristics that made the soil of Lowndes County so ideal for growing cotton, are now causing significant health and quality of life problems for the county’s citizens. The high clay content of the soil means that water infiltrates at a very slow rate. This is particularly a problem because 82% of Lowndes county residents reside in rural areas that are not served by conventional municipal sewer systems and therefore rely on septic systems that require porous soils to function properly [4]. Small-scale, spatially distributed septic systems generally have a concrete tank that collects influent from a home. Solids settle out in the tank and then liquids travel into a system of perforated pipes where water is supposed to infiltrate back into the soil. 
                </p>

                <small>Septic tank diagram (source: http://www.uri.org.al/)</small></p> 
                <p>The US Geological Survey characterizes the aptitude of soils for use with septic tanks based on infiltration rates, depth to water table and flooding frequency, along with other factors. The map on the right shows that nearly the entire county has been classified as very limited in its potential to effectively treat wastewater with septic tanks, and yet the citizens of Lowndes county are expected to continue using a technology that has been proven ineffective [5].</p>

            <section data-scene="water">
                <h2>Water</h2>
                <p>Wastewater management is an issue for more than a billion people worldwide and Lowndes County shows that the United States is not an exception to this problem. As noted, county residents are largely reliant on spatially disaggregated septic systems built for specific homes or sets of homes to deal with their wastewater, and yet “The Alabama Department of Public Health has reported that 50% of all conventional, onsite septic systems are currently failing or are expected to fail in the future’’[6].</p>
                <p><div  id="pieChart3"></div><small>Water related complaints in Haynesville, years 2012-2017. A majority of water related complaints were related  to sewage issues even in Hayneville, the county seat which has access to municipal water systems.</small></p> 
                <p>Due to historical injustice and lack of economic opportunity, many people are unable to make the changes required to keep these systems functioning. A review of a small sample of public complaints from 2012-2017 suggests that 40% of water related complaints in Lowndes County are about sewage overflow and one third of the complaints relate to leaking sewage or broken sewer lines. Other research has shown that more than 40% of residents reported having sewage backup into their homes [7].  As a result, many residents are forced to rely on ‘straight piping’ or direct piping of waste from their homes to an an adjacent outdoor space. This waste then persists and can be exacerbated during heavy rains and flooding. Human interaction with contaminated water leads to the prevalence and perpetuation of the hookworm problem. A small sample of 55 people showed more than a third of adults in Lowndes County were infected with helminthes (hookworm).
                </p>
                <p>Although there are significant physical, social and economic impediments to adequately treating wastewater, in 2002, 37 families from Lowndes County were threatened with fines and jail time for not treating household wastewater properly [8] and at least 10 African American residents were formally charged with violating the Alabama State Code for operating sewage disposal systems that posed a public health risk between 1990-2002 [9]. Involvement of the district court in this light highlighted the institutionalized barriers to adequate sanitation in poor, rural areas of the Alabama Black Belt [10].

            <section data-scene="health2">
                <h2>Hookworm distribution in the world</h2>
                <p>There are likely close to one billion people infected with hookworm in the world today. The vast majority of these cases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast, South and East Asia, and parts of South America. The range of hookworm species is determined by important aspects of the physical landscape and because of this, as well as critical overlapping characteristics of the human social landscape, the occurrence of hookworm in humans is distinctly delineated by geographic features. Soil and climate are two critical landscape features that determine the distribution of hookworm species. During the first two larval stages of development in the life cycle, the larvae require sandy, loamy soils in order to undergo the first two molts to the L3 stage, which can then infect humans. In addition, the soils must be moist and the temperature must be warm. As such, the specific climatic conditions limit the parasite’s range to the tropical and subtropical regions of the world that receive significant amounts of precipitation on an annual basis, while the local soil characteristics further defines the microgeography of these worms.

                <p>Lack of sanitation infrastructure, especially a means by which human waste can be removed from sites of human occupation, results in feces being distributed directly in the human environment or in proximal living spaces. This leads to an abundance of points of contact for transmission between hookworm larvae and human hosts in these intersecting landscapes of warm, moist, structurally rich soils and conditions of poverty. With human waste containing hookworm present in the environment,  people who are barefoot or otherwise have some contact between skin and contaminant (generally through the feet), can become infected. The global extent of hookworm is currently defined by a geography that encompasses, almost exclusively, the developing world.  [11]/p>

                <h2>Hookworm infection in Lowndes County</h2>
                <p>Due to the known problem with hookworm secondary to open sewage systems, Lowndes County, Alabama was chosen as a study site for a parasitic burden investigation in 2017. The study found that 34.5% out of 55 stool samples tested positive for Necator americanus (hookworm) [9].

                <p>Hookworm is a parasitic worm that can penetrate human skin and crawl into the small intestines which leads to intestinal diseases. Hookworm is spread through human feces of an infected person. If a infected person defecates outside the eggs can hatch and crawl into the soil, where hookworms can then attach themselves those barefeet or other exposed skin. 
                Hookworm was believed to have been eradicated in the United States in the early 20th century, where it was prevalent in the southeast. Recently we have seen a recurrence of the disease, particularly in Lowndes County, Alabama where it is estimated that nearly 30% of the population of the county is infected [13].

                <p>It is important to recognize the people who have been working for years to try and address these issues in Lowndes County. The Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise (ACRE) has been a leading advocate for the people of Lowndes County with its mission statement of “Targeting the Root Causes of Poverty”. The center was founded in 2002 by Catherine Coleman Flowers a lifelong resident of Lowndes County who has worked extensively to advocate for the people of Lowndes. Catherine has a deep understanding of systemic apathy and injustice that have plagued the citizens of Lowndes county and works tirelessly to communicate the needs of the community and connect with those who may be able to help make meaningful change. In recent years ACRE has focused on the issues regarding wastewater disposal as the conditions in Lowndes county create serious health risks to the citizens as well as pushing many to migrate away from the county which negatively impacts the county’s economy and proliferates the cycles of poverty.

                <p><p>The citizens of Lowndes County have been forced to live in unsanitary conditions for decades, and this is not an isolated case. The same conditions that cause these issues in Lowndes exist throughout the Black Belt region of Alabama.  These are American citizens who are living in conditions and with parasitic diseases  that are typically only found in the most poverty stricken. America is the birthplace of some of the greatest minds in history surely in the 21st century we can ensure that Americans do not have to live surrounded by open sewage. </p>

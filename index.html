                <h2>Lowndes County</h2>
                <p>In the US we often take sanitation for granted, we flush the toilet and move along with the day without giving the waste a second thought. But imagine having that waste show up in your yard, and having to live with it on a daily basis, or even worse it backing up into your home after a heavy rain. Imagine that to ensure the waste would be removed you would have to pay a full year’s salary, and that if you could not pay for this system in time you would be fined by the government and potentially even arrested for failing to act. Imagine if due to the characteristics of the soil and your inability to spend thousands of dollars on a septic system, that would likely fail in a matter of years, you and your children would be exposed to parasitic hookworms.  This is, and has been, the everyday reality for the citizens of Lowndes county.

                    <small>Located southwest of Montgomery, Alabama, Lowndes County is acutely experiencing historical legacies of racism and witness to political disregard of immediate water sanitation and subsequent water quality related health challenges. Historically a site of plantation slavery, Lowndes County is a politically marginalized community, whose voice has been disregarded. Situated in a geography with nearly impenetrable soils, and an economically disenfranchised community who has limited means to implement and install traditional methods of addressing sewage containment, citizens of Lowndes County are currently dealing with issues of access to adequate health resources to respond to the repercussions of sewage overflow. This story map will walk through the historical and current physical geography and social conditions that predicate the ongoing injustice in Lowndes County.

                <h2>Historic Context</h2>
                <p>The current waste water management issues in Lowndes County, are better understood when viewed within the context of the county’s past. Lowndes County is located in the center of Alabama’s Black Belt region, originally named for the rich, black topsoil that allowed the production of plantation crops, particularly cotton, to thrive. This agricultural industry profited through the exploitation of enslaved peoples. Many of these people’s descendants still live in the Black Belt, adding a second connotation to the term. Stark power and wealth disparities along racial lines have been a fixture in the region, with the county once being known as “Bloody Lowndes” in reference to the high frequency of white violence used to control and terrorize the black residents. For many years the scare tactics were effective, in 1964 the county was 80% Black and yet not a single Black citizen was registered to vote (1).</p><p>

                    <p><img src="img/LCFO4.jpg" width="100%"/>
                <p>The citizens of the county played major roles in the Civil Rights era with the creation of Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO) which worked to register Black voters and introduced the Black Panther symbol which would later be adopted in Oakland, California, and throughout the nation 2.When hundreds including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr passed through Lowndes county on their historic march from Selma to Montgomery many citizens of the county came to cheer them on and offer food and water with full knowledge that these actions could make them targets for violence, the county also served as a rest and camp site for 300 protesters during the march 3. This activist spirit can still be seen in the county today in Organizations like The Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise (ACRE) which are working to address the needs of hard working citizens who still face disproportionate rates of poverty, and waste water management issues that expose them to disease which have been eradicated throughout most of the U.S. for decades. When looking at Lowndes county’s past a pattern of mistreatment and neglect of the citizens appears, and the apathy towards the wastewater problems by those in power seems to be a continuation of this pattern.</p>

                <h2>Geology</h2>
                <p>The same soil characteristics that made the soil of Lowndes county so apt for growing cotton, are now causing significant health and quality of life problems to the county’s citizens. The high clay content of the soil means that water infiltrates at a very slow rate. The geologic challenges of the area are compounded by the socio economic realities of the county. 82% of Lowndes county residents reside in rural areas that are not served by conventional municipal sewer systems. These residents are responsible for implementing and maintaining their own onsite wastewater systems, in a region with some of the highest poverty rates in the nation and soil which is not conducive to typical septic tank based treatment system, the result is a community of people who do not have the means to treat their wastewater and are forced to pipe the water into open lagoons which are highly unsanitary and foster a multitude of parasites and pathogens.</p>

                <small>Septic tank diagram (source: http://www.uri.org.al/)</small></p> 
                <p>The US Geological Survey characterizes the aptitude of soils for use with septic tanks based on infiltration rates, depth to water table, flooding frequency, along with other factors. The map on the right shows that nearly the entire county has been classified as very limited in its potential to effectively treat wastewater with septic tanks and yet the citizens of Lowndes county are expected to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for septic systems that are expected to fail. </p>

                <p>The ethnic composition of the population of Lowndes County, AL is composed of 7,886 Black residents (74.6%), 2,578 White residents (24.4%), 50 Hispanic residents (0.47%), 43 Two+ residents (0.41%), and 8 Native residents (0.08%). Furthermore, 97.6% of residents living below the poverty line, identify as Black or African-American (Fig. 1 and 2) The largest population of residents living in poverty are females age 35-44. Furthermore, the higher-education student population collectively from Elmore, Autauga, Montgomery (Outer) & Lowndes Counties PUMA, AL is skewed away from females, with 427 male students and 102 female students(2).

                <p>The median income level for Lowndes County is $27,914, which is nearly half of the median income for the United States at $55,322. The most common occupations held in the county are in the manufacturing, healthcare and social assistance, retail trade, educational services, and public administration services. Lowndes county has seen a decrease in property values from a median values of $71,400 in 2013 down to $67,800 in 2015. This is still significantly lower than the national median of $176,700 or even the state median of $122,500. In 2016 73.6% of the houses in Lowndes County were occupied by their owners. 99% of the residents of Lowndes county are citizens of the United States. </p>
                <p>Due to economic constraints, makeshift methods of wastewater disposal, otherwise known as “straight-piping” were adopted. In 2002, 37 families from Lowndes County, Alabama were threatened with fines and jail time for not treating household wastewater properly (3) and at least 10 African American residents were formally charged with violating the Alabama State Code for operating sewage disposal systems that posed a public health risk between 1990-2002 (1). Involvement of the district court in this light highlighted the institutionalized barriers to adequate sanitation in poor, rural areas of the Alabama Black Belt (4). </p>

                <p>Lowndes County, Alabama, given previous high hookworm burdens, degree of poverty, and use of open-sewage systems was chosen as a study site for a parasitic burden investigation in 2017. 34.5% out of 55 stool samples tested positive for Necator americanus (hookworm) (1).</p>

                <p>Hookworm is a parasitic worm that can penetrate human skin and crawl into the small intestines which leads to intestinal diseases. Hookworm is spread through human feces of an infected person. If a infected person defecates outside the eggs can hatch and crawl into the soil, where hookworms can then attach themselves those barefeet or other exposed skin. People who live in warm, moist climates are most at risk, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene. </p>
                <p>Hookworm was believed to have been eradicated in the United States in the early 20th century, where it was prevalent in the southeast. Recently we have seen a recurrence of the disease, particularly in Lowndes County, Alabama where it is estimated that nearly 30% of the population of the county is infected (2).</p>

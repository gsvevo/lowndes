(1) e-mail #1 from Jeff Williams, Ground\nWater Section \"Hey Kelvin, Loren is out of the office today and my boss asked me to check on the\nattached complaint we received. I spoke with the Town Clerk and she said the contractors are still\nworking on the line replacement. I’m just guessing that the project is taking much longer than it\nnormally would due to all of the heavy rain. It was extremely soft when we were there in May and\nwe’ve probably had foot of rain since then. Anyway, when you have a few minutes would you respond\nto this email and just give us a brief status report on the line replacement, creek bores, etcetera.\nThanks and have a good weekend. (2) e-mail #2 from Kevin Lawrence \"Jeff the contractor has\nfinished the road bores, the connections has to be made. They should be complete a week from\ntoday. If you need any further updates just let me know.\" Thanks. Kevin J Lawrence.\" Therefore,\nbased on the e-mails from Loren Crawford, this complaint was closed on 6\/19\/14.)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -86.597843085043351, 32.223928609582238, 0.0 ] } },
